# Django-Blog-
A blog website created using the Django framework 

This website contains:
  -User Profiles
  -Password Reset
  -Blog Posts
  -Updating and Deleting Posts

This was a project for me to learn the django framework. I wanted to use this project to learn more about django before starting a larger project for a customer. 
This is suppose to be a simple blog website with basic features in order to get my foot in the door, any feedback or critiques would be appreciated.
